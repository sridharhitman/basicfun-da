<h1>1. What common English verb becomes its own past tence by rearranging its letters?</h1>
<h3> Answer:Eat</h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>2. Logic Puzzle: There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?</h1>
<h3> Answer: Three. Two ducks are in front of the last duck; the first duck has two ducks behind; one duck is between the other two. </h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>3. Five people were eating apples, A finished before B, but behind C. D finished before E, but behind B. What was the finishing order?</h1>
<h3> Answer: CABDE. Putting the first three in order, A finished in front of B but behind C, so CAB. Then, we know D finished before B, so CABD. We know E finished after D, so CABDE.</h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>4. Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we don’t know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?</h1>
<h3> Answer: Yes. If Anne is married, then she is married and looking at George, who is unmarried. If Anne is unmarried, then Jack, who is married, is looking at her. Either way, the statement is correct.</h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>5. The day before two days after the day before tomorrow is Saturday. What day is it today?</h1>
<h3> Answer:Friday. The “day before tomorrow” is today; “the day before two days after” is really one day after. So if “one day after today is Saturday,” then it must be Friday.</h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>6.  This “burning rope” problem is a classic logic puzzle. You have two ropes that each take an hour to burn, but burn at inconsistent rates. How can you measure 45 minutes? (You can light one or both ropes at one or both ends at the same time.)</h1>
<h3> Answer: Because they both burn inconsistently, you can’t just light one end of a rope and wait until it’s 75 percent of the way through. But, this is what you can do: Light the first rope at both ends, and light the other rope at one end, all at the same time. The first rope will take 30 minutes to burn (even if one side burns faster than the other, it still takes 30 minutes). The moment the first rope goes out, light the other end of the second rope. Because the time elapsed of the second rope burning was 30 minutes, the remaining rope will also take 30 minutes; lighting it from both ends will cut that in half to 15 minutes, giving you 45 minutes all together.</h3>

<h1>7. You’re at a fork in the road in which one direction leads to the City of Lies (where everyone always lies) and the other to the City of Truth (where everyone always tells the truth). There’s a person at the fork who lives in one of the cities, but you’re not sure which one. What question could you ask the person to find out which road leads to the City of Truth?</h1>
<h3> Answer: “Which direction do you live?” Someone from the City of Lies will lie and point to the City of Truth; someone from the City of Truth would tell the truth and also point to the City of Truth</h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>8. There are three people (Alex, Ben and Cody), one of whom is a knight, one a knave, and one a spy. The knight always tells the truth, the knave always lies, and the spy can either lie or tell the truth. Alex says: “Cody is a knave.” Ben says: “Alex is a knight.” Cody says: “I am the spy.” Who is the knight, who the knave, and who the spy?</h1>
<h3> Answer: We know Ben isn’t telling the truth because if he was, there would be two knights; so Ben could be either the knave or the spy. Cody also can’t be the knight, because then his statement would be a lie. So that must mean Alex is the knight. Ben, therefore, must be the spy, since the spy sometimes tells the truth; leaving Cody as the knave. </h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>9. A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage. He has a boat, but it can only fit himself plus either the wolf, the goat or the cabbage. If the wolf and the goat are alone on one shore, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and the cabbage are alone on the shore, the goat will eat the cabbage. How can the farmer bring the wolf, the goat and the cabbage across the river without anything being eaten? </h1>
<h3> Answer: First, the farmer takes the goat across. The farmer returns alone and then takes the wolf across, but returns with the goat. Then the farmer takes the cabbage across, leaving it with the wolf and returning alone to get the goat.</h3>
<br><br><br><hr>
<h1>10. A girl meets a lion and unicorn in the forest. The lion lies every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and the other days he speaks the truth. The unicorn lies on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, and the other days of the week he speaks the truth. “Yesterday I was lying,” the lion told the girl. “So was I,” said the unicorn. What day is it?</h1>
<h3> Answer:  Thursday. The only day they both tell the truth is Sunday; but today can’t be Sunday because the lion also tells the truth on Saturday (yesterday). Going day by day, the only day one of them is lying and one of them is telling the truth with those two statements is Thursday.</h3>
